            <h2>What Are Renewable Energy Sources?</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy sources are energy sources that are replenished naturally and can be used continuously without depleting resources. As global concerns about climate change and energy security grow, transitioning to renewable energy has become increasingly crucial for creating a sustainable future. These sources include:</p>

            <h3>Types of Renewable Energy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> This involves harnessing sunlight using solar panels. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electricity, while solar thermal systems use sunlight to produce heat for water or space heating.</li>
                <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power, which can then be used to generate electricity. Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing energy sources globally.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> By using the flow of water in rivers and dams, hydropower generates electricity. It is one of the oldest and most reliable renewable energy sources and can provide a stable energy supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> This energy comes from the Earth's core and can be utilized for electricity generation or direct heating applications. Geothermal power plants can operate continuously, making them a reliable energy source.</li>
                <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Biomass energy is produced from organic materials, such as plant and animal waste. It can be converted into biofuels or used directly for heating and electricity generation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Benefits of Renewable Energy</h3>
            <p>Renewable energy offers numerous benefits that can positively impact both the environment and society:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gases during operation, which helps mitigate climate change.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Security:</strong> Diversifying energy sources enhances energy security and reduces dependence on imported fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Creation:</strong> The renewable energy sector creates jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Investments in renewable energy stimulate local economies and promote technological innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Reduced air and water pollution from renewable sources leads to better public health outcomes.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Interesting Fun Facts About Renewable Energy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The total amount of solar energy that hits the Earth in one hour is enough to power the world's energy needs for an entire year.</li>
                <li>Wind energy has the potential to provide more than 40 times the electricity currently consumed in the U.S.</li>
                <li>Geothermal power plants emit about 97% less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel plants.</li>
                <li>According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the renewable energy sector employed over 11 million people globally in 2018.</li>
            </ul>
