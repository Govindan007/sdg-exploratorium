            <h3>Understanding Ecosystem Changes</h3>
            <p>Ecosystems are constantly changing due to various natural and human-induced factors. Understanding these changes is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance. Here are some key points about ecosystem changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Urbanization, deforestation, and agriculture are leading causes of habitat loss, affecting countless species.</li>
                <li><strong>Invasive Species:</strong> Non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems, often outcompeting native species for resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Altered weather patterns can shift habitats and species distributions, impacting ecosystem services.</li>
                <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Contaminants can harm wildlife and degrade habitat quality, leading to decreased biodiversity.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Exploitation:</strong> Overfishing, hunting, and logging can deplete resources and disrupt ecosystem dynamics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ecosystem Changes</h3>
            <p>Ecosystems are complex networks of living organisms and their physical environments, and they are profoundly affected by climate change. As global temperatures rise and weather patterns shift, many ecosystems are experiencing significant changes that threaten their stability. For instance, forests, wetlands, and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable. Increased temperatures can lead to shifts in species distributions, with some species migrating to cooler areas, while others face extinction if they cannot adapt or relocate. Coral reefs, often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," are experiencing coral bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures and acidification, which devastates marine biodiversity. Furthermore, altered precipitation patterns affect freshwater availability, leading to changes in plant growth and wildlife habitats. These changes can disrupt food webs, threaten species that rely on specific environmental conditions, and reduce biodiversity overall. Understanding ecosystem changes is essential for students, as it highlights the interconnectedness of life and the importance of protecting our natural environments to ensure a balanced and sustainable future.</p>

            <h3>Fun Facts About Ecosystem Changes</h3>
            <ul id="fun-facts" class="list-unstyled">
                <li><strong>Fact 1:</strong> Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems, but they are disappearing at an alarming rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Fact 2:</strong> The Amazon rainforest produces 20% of the world's oxygen.</li>
                <li><strong>Fact 3:</strong> Invasive species cost the global economy over $100 billion each year.</li>
                <li><strong>Fact 4:</strong> Wetlands provide critical habitat for many species and act as natural water filters.</li>
                <li><strong>Fact 5:</strong> Forests cover about 30% of the Earth's land area but are being lost at a rate of 13 million hectares per year.</li>
            </ul>
