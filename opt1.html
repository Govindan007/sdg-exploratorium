            <h2>Understanding Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are driving an unprecedented rate of change.</p>

            <h3>What Causes Climate Change?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> The burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Trees absorb CO2; when they are cut down, not only is this CO2 not absorbed, but the carbon stored in trees is released back into the atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Livestock and certain farming practices release methane, another potent greenhouse gas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Effects of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Climate change has far-reaching impacts, including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme Weather:</strong> Increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes, droughts, and floods disrupt ecosystems and human lives.</li>
                <li><strong>Impacts on Biodiversity:</strong> Many species struggle to adapt to changing climates, leading to habitat loss and extinction.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Fun Facts About Climate Change</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Since 1880, the Earth's average surface temperature has risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
                <li>Glaciers and ice sheets store about 69% of the worldâ€™s freshwater.</li>
                <li>Coral reefs are highly sensitive to temperature changes; even a 1-2 degree Celsius increase can lead to coral bleaching.</li>
                <li>According to NASA, 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing climate change.</li>
            </ul>
